= Introduction =

Currently, smx comes with a perl program that parses the unix Makefile.am's, and compiles based somwwhat on them.

= Details =

 * install the development versions of [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=240780 MinGW ], [http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html OpenSSL], [http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi Apache] & [http://www.sqlite.org/download.html SQLite]

 * Open up Win32Build.conf in a text editor

 * If you need to, change the MinGW, OpenSSL & Apache paths to match wherever you installed them, most likely they don't need to be changed.

 * To build run 

    perl Win32Build.pl

 * to make a release tarball, run 

    perl Win32Build.pl release

 * to run tests

    perl Win32Build.pl check

 * to set the "debug" flag on (while building any of the above)

    perl Win32Build.pl -debug
