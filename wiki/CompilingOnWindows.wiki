= Introduction =

Currently, smx comes with a perl program that parses the unix Makefile.am's, and compiles based on them.   The program is not terribly configurable yet, but I like the idea, and might get it to be some sort of generic system.

= Details =

 * install the development versions of [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=240780 MinGW ], [http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html OpenSSL], [http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi Apache] & [http://www.sqlite.org/download.html SQLite]

 * Open up Win32Build.pl in a text editor

 * Change the MinGW, OpenSSL, Apache & SQLite paths to match wherever you installed them

 * To build run 

    perl Win32Build.pl

 * to make a distribution tarball, run 

    perl Win32Build.pl dist

 * to run tests

    perl Win32Build.pl check
