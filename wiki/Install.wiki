= Install Linux =

rpm -i smx-(ver)-(rel).rpm

RPM will warn you if the requirements aren't there, etc.

If you need to, you can rpmbuild --rebuild from the smx-(ver)-(rel).src.rpm

= Install Windows =

On Windows, there's currently no installer, so you get a zipped up file 
with the following:

smx.exe - executable
libsmx.dll - dll file must be in the path
libmodsmx.dll - dll file for apache 2, use LoadModule to load it
libextperl.dll - dll file for perl extension module, use %module() to load it

However, these all depend on several other files being installed first:

 * SQLite : Just install the sqlitedll version for Windows
       http://www.sqlite.org/download.html

 * Apache : Latest binary with or without ssl, as needed:
       http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

 * OpenSSL : Latest binary release, unless you already installed apache, in which case you can just copy the libeay32.dll to your windows directory:
       http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html
