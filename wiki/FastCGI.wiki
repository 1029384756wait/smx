#summary Using SMX with FastCGI
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

The smx-fcgi program is not yet installed by default, so you'll have to compile it.  It has only been tested, so far, on Linux & BSD.

= Details =

Use smx-fcgi for servers that support fast-cgi.  It's much faster.

The environment varialbe SMX_INIT can be used for initialization macros (analogous to the Apache SMXInit directive).

smx-fcgi can be used as an auth filter if the 'http-user' macro
is defined somewhere via SMX_INIT, just like under apache.

 * http-user is only used if smx-fcgi is also installed as an fast-cgi auth filter
 * http-init is supported as a per-page macro.
 * http-nomagic is supported, just like in Apache, to turn off magic processing, if it evaluates to a true value then all pages will get parsed.

Again, all these macros must be defined by setting someting in the SMX_INIT environment.

For example in lighthttpd:

    setenv.add-environment = ( 
      "SMX_INIT" => "%module(/var/www/global.smx)",
    )
