<h2>SMX Installation</h2>

<p class="subHeader">Installing the RPM:</p>

Download rpms from <A href="http://smx.googlecode.com">Google Code</A>.
<P>
Optional prerequisites are unixODBC-2.x, openssl-0.9, gd-2.x, sqlite-3.x, and httpd-2.x.
<P>
We highly recommend getting the source from CVS and building RPMs for your own platform and specs.  
SMX RPM building is easy.  Just run "make dist" for the tarball, and "rpmbuild -ta" for the rpm! 
<p>

<p class="subHeader">Getting the source from SVN:</p>

<pre>svn checkout http://smx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ smx-read-only</pre>

or for project members:

<pre>svn checkout https://smx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ smx --username [your username]</re>

That should get all the code.  If you want to submit a patch, run svn diff, and 
send the output to patches@smxlang.org.

<p class="subHeader">Prerequisites for Linux:</p>

<p>You can install all of these as RPM's from www.rpmfind.net, or using apt-get, or yum:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Required for Crypto support: 
<dd>openssl, openssl-devel

<dt>Required for ODBC support: 
<dd><a href="http://www.unixodbc.org/">unixODBC</a>, unixODBC-devel (fedora) OR unixodbc-dev (debian)

<dt>Required for IMAGE support: 
<dd>gd, gd-devel (<a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">graphics library</a> by Thomas Boutell)

<dt>Required for SQLITE support: 
<dd>sqlite, sqlite-devel (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite</a>)

<dt>Required for Apache 2.0 module support:
<dd>httpd-devel (fedora)  OR apache2-dev (debian)
</dl>

<p>Future versions of smx will probably REQUIRE sqlite, since it works so much more reliably than berkely and tdb, and seems to compile easliy on most platforms.

<p>If desired for backward compatibility, download TDB from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb">https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb</a>.

Once all the prerequisites are installed, you should be able to run:

<pre>./configure
./make
./make install
</pre>

<p>Go to the <a href="#apache">Configuring Apache</a> section.</p>

<p class="subHeader">Prerequisites for Windows:</p>

<P>Download and compile the latest versions of apache and openssl from apache.org and openssl.org.</P>

<p>Windows compilation requires that you add all the .cpp and .h files for each directory to a separate project.</p>

<p>Make libsmx and modsmx DLL projects, and SMX an EXE project.</p>

<p>You will need to adjust paths, and manually create a config.h so that apache, apr, gd, sqlite, openssl and libsmx are all in your project's path.</p>

<p class="subHeader"><a name=apache>Configuring Apache:</a></p>

<p>
 The httpd.conf should have lines like this in it:
 </p>
<pre> LoadModule smx_module /usr/lib/libmodsmx.so
 AddHandler smx-parsed .htm
 AddHandler smx-parsed .html
 AddHandler smx-parsed .hmx
</pre>

<p> and in the individual VirtualHost sections, you may want to have 
 something
 like:
 </p>

<pre> SMXInit %%module(/var/www/html/global.htx) </pre>

<p>
 That should do it -- please email with any steps that were different 
 in
 your configuration, or if you find any steps that were left out.
